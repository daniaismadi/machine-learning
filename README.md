## A1: Exploring Deep Neural Networks and CNNs using Python
Part 1: I explore different Deep Neural Network architectures, various activation functions used, forward and back propagation, computational graphs and calculating stochastic gradient descent (SGD) update equations.

Part 2: Using Tensorflow, I develop a deep neural network architecture using the ReLU and softmax activation functions to complete an image recognition task. Then, I work with the FashionMNIST data set to train, test and validate my model. I consequently achieved 86.5% validation accuracy.

Part 3: I develop a convolutional neural network to classify pictures of animals using an existing dataset. I attempt to improve upon the model by applying data augmentation and tuning hyperparameters such as the optimizer, the batch size, the learning rate, the number of filters, the type of weight initialization technique (He or Xavier), the drop rate, and changing the number of epochs. I also explore adversarial attacks by attacking the model with the PGD and FGSM methods, reporting its robust accuracies and observing how it affects the image classification tasks.

## A2: Neural Embedding and Sequence Modelling
Used Text Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks for sequence modelling and neural embedding. I further improved the Recurrent Neural Network developed by tuning the parameters including the cell type, embedding model, state sizes, network type and embedding size for the RNN. Then, I used this model to enter a Kaggle competition to which I achieved a score of 98.8%.
